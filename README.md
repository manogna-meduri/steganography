TITLE: STEGANOGRAPHY BASED TEXT EMBEDDING IN IMAGES


This code is an example of steganography, where a secret message is hidden within an image file. Here is a brief description:

Dictionaries for Character Encoding:

d maps characters to their ASCII values.
c maps ASCII values back to characters.
Reading the Image:

The image is loaded from a specified path using OpenCV.
The dimensions of the image are retrieved.
Input for Security Key and Text:

The user is prompted to input a security key and the text they wish to hide.
Encoding Text into the Image:

The text is encoded into the image using XOR operation with the security key. This involves iterating over the text and modifying the pixel values of the image.
The modified pixel values are stored back in the image.
Saving the Encrypted Image:

The modified image with the hidden text is saved as a new file.
The new image file is opened to show the user.
Decoding the Text:

The user is prompted to choose whether they want to unhide the text.
If yes, the user must input the security key.
The code checks if the provided key matches the original key.
If the keys match, the hidden message is retrieved from the image by reversing the encoding process and printed out.
